'isconnected matrix ko vector m convert krna '

vector<vector<int>> isConnected = {
    {1, 1, 0, 0},
    {1, 1, 0, 0},
    {0, 0, 1, 1},
    {0, 0, 1, 1}
};



this is how my isConnected looks like 
it means 0-0 kbhi apas m connect nhi ho skte 
0-1 are connected ...

matrix to vector<int> adjLS[v];
